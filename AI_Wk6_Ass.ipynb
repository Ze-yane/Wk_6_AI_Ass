Provide a real-world example.\n","\n","Edge AI refers to running AI models locally on devices like(e.g., sensors, smartphones, drones, embedded systems) instead of sending data to distant cloud servers for processing.\n","\n","How Edge AI reduces latency\n","\n","* In cloud AI, data must be transmitted from the device → internet → cloud server → back to the device.\n","* This round-trip communication causes delays, especially where networks are slow or unstable.\n","* Edge AI processes data directly on the device, eliminating the need for continuous cloud communication.\n","* This enables real-time decision making, often in milliseconds.\n","\n","How Edge AI enhances privacy\n","\n","* Sensitive data never leaves the device, reducing the risk of interception or breaches.\n","* Less reliance on cloud storage limits exposure to external servers, attackers, and unauthorized access.\n","* Edge devices can anonymize or encrypt data before ever sending it to the cloud (if sending is needed at all).\n","\n","Real-world example: Autonomous drones\n","\n","* Autonomous drones used in search and rescue or military surveillance rely on fast image recognition and navigation.\n","* With Edge AI, the drone can:\n","\n","  * Detect obstacles\n","  * Identify humans\n","  * Plan routes\n","  * Respond to threats\n","    all onboard, with no internet required.\n","* If cloud processing were used, delays could cause collisions or mission failure.\n","* Edge processing also ensures that captured images/data stay local, improving operational privacy.\n","\n","---\n","\n","Q2: Compare Quantum AI and classical AI in solving optimization problems.

Faster search:Quantum algorithms (e.g., Grover’s algorithm, QAOA) can find optimal or near-optimal solutions exponentially faster for certain tasks.\n","3.
